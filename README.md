#### FAQ
- What does this plugin do?
  - It adds a Label to the Wordpress Toolbar Menu, to the left of the user icon that allows you to Publish or Update the post you are in without scrolling to the top of the page to find the `Publish` or `Update` button.
- Why does this exist?
  - Because if you work Wordpress and use the Classic Editor you'll often find yourself scrolling up to the top of the page to click publish. If you have to QA or update pages often in Wordpress this can get tedious and very, very annoying. Now there's just a button in the toolbar. No more fussing with that pesky scroll bar!
- What versions of Wordpress does this work with?
  - Good question. I've only tested it with ![WP Version 5.8.2 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/5.8.2-blue), but in theory it should work with as far back as ![WP Version 3.0.1 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.0.1-blue) because that's when the most recent aspect of the plugin—`admin_bar_menu`—was added.
- Is this plugin on the Wordpress Plugins database yet?
  - Nope, but I'm working on it.
- How do I install this?
  - Go to the Releases link on the right, or click [here](https://github.com/daltonjmcgee/toolbar_plugin/releases/tag/v1.0.1).
  - Download the toolbar_publish.zip file, (or again click [here](https://github.com/daltonjmcgee/toolbar_publish/releases/download/v1.0.1/toolbar_publish.zip))
  - Navigate to the plugins page of your Wordpress site
  - Click "Add New"
  - Click "Upload Plugin"
  - Choose the Zip from wherever you saved it.
  - Once activated, you should be good to go.
